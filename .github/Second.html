        <p> My highschool is Elvebakken vgs.
            Our former canteen lady is kind of famous. Her name is Wenche and she is featured in the youtube video "Wenches Cafeteria - Taco baguette". I reccomend watching it!
            Our school also had a secret room that you had to find by yourself, as no one would tell you were it is. I never found it...

            My VGS was built in 2018 and we was the first students to go the full 3 years on the new school. Even thought the school was new, they forgot to build a parking lot, a ilbrary and wardrobes.

            My Vgs was in Bryne, we hade one of the largest schools in norway with 1600 students. We all loved our cafeteria, especially on mondays when it was farsa. We had the best teachers south of finnmark.
