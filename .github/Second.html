        <p> My highschool is Elvebakken vgs.
            Our former canteen lady is kind of famous. Her name is Wenche and she is featured in the youtube video "Wenches Cafeteria - Taco baguette". I reccomend watching it!
            Our school also had a secret room that you had to find by yourself, as no one would tell you were it is. I never found it... </p>
